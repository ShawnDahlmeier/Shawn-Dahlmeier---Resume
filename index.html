        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a part time worker at an on campus location called the SRC: Student Recreation Center. This is my first time having a job and I have learned so many useful lessons along my 12 months as a Building Steward. I have held many leadership opportunities in my time in High School as I was my Associated Student Body Commissioner of Activities where throughout my Senior year I spearheaded a small committee of six students to brainstorm various activities throughout the academic year to ensure each grade level was represented and fairly heard. Organized all school affiliated events by creating inclusive outlets for all students to encourage school spirit. This was an extremely rewarding experience as I was able to manage all social media accounts and branded the school as both unity and diversity to represent all students. As Baking For A Cause Vice President and then President, I managed daily agendas and led club-wide meetings while maintaining constant communication with members, advisors, and the board cohort. Organized the club’s donations as well as planned monthly bake sales to raise more than $1,000 for the Los Angeles Food Bank.

        As a Public Policy major I have learned to become analyst and solution based thinker as I research specific policies and its effects on certain communities. My passion for law and politics goes far beyond my breadth courses and introduction classes but rather it started as a middle schooler and only being able to read books on historical events. In my time as ASB commissioner of activities had allowed me to create a brand for an organization and I loved this aspect therefore I decided my winter quarter of freshman year to minor in marketing. The business aspect as a career incites enthusiasm for me and I wish to use this minor in order to find a balance of law and commerce in order to deduce a good career for me. 

I have some certification with my Biliteracy Seal in May of 2021. I was acknowledged by the State of California & Torrance School Unified District for my proficiency in Korean and English which was confirmed by a Chairman of the Torrance High Language Department. Just last year I got a CPR certification in December 2021. I Recognized by the American Red Cross as Adult and Pediatric First Aid/CPR/AED Certified.
Los Angeles POSSE Scholarship Semi-Finalist (Northwestern) in November of 2020. I Ranked in the top 13 out of 2,300+ High School senior students in the greater Los Angeles area. What is Social? Northwestern Coursera Certificate in June 2020 I took it upon myself to expand my knowledge on the ability to grow a social media strategy and comprehend the impact of marketing media outlets to desired audiences. I love snoop dogg. He is so awesome and cool and I love him. My friend Jaela thinks he is a gilf grandpa she likes to lol anyways. His superbowl performance was so mid lol he flop lowkey but i still love him anyways.
